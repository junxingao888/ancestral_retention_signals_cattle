# Protein structure prediction for candidate genes
Further annotation of the DDIT3 gene was performed using Ensembl VEP v113.3 on the ARS-UCD1.3 bovine reference genome to precisely identify coding variants. Protein sequences with/without mutation were retrieved from the Ensembl database (https://www.ensembl.org/Bos_taurus/Transcript/). Protein structure predictions were conducted using the AlphaFold web server (https://alphafoldserver.com/), and resulting 3D protein structures were visualized and compared using UCSF ChimeraX
