# ancestral_retention_signals_cattle

Domestic cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are pivotal to global animal-based food products but face intensifying pressures from climate change, infectious disease, and inconsistent resource supplies. Understanding how admixture and selection have shaped resilience in indigenous populations is essential to conserving genetic diversity and guiding sustainable breeding. Here, we present whole-genome sequences from 519 cattle across 24 indigenous African and European populations, complemented with 104 public genomes from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This diverse dataset reveals complex mosaic ancestry among African taurine, European taurine, and indicine lineages, and identifies 48 candidate genes with adaptive allele retention linked to heat and starvation resistance, immune function, radiation tolerance, energy metabolism, and productivity. This study provides new insights into how ecological variability has shaped the selective retention of advantageous ancestral variants in cattle, thereby informing future breeding strategies to address emerging challenges.

# data availability
Whole-genome sequences for the 519 indigenous European and African cattle analyzed in this study are deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under PRJEB90816 (European) and PRJEB90914 (African). Publicly available variants used as references were obtained from the 1000 Bull Genomes Project (Run 9; PRJNA391427, ERZ14211345). Sample identifiers for the ancestry reference panels (AFT, N = 34; EUT, N = 29; AFI, N = 25; AAI, N = 29) are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Processed data products, including sample- and variant-level summary statistics, admixture statistics, and dating summaries, are provided as Supplementary Tables. All custom code and workflows (Linux shell, R, and Python) for read processing, variant calling, local-ancestry inference, selection scans, and figure generation are available at https://github.com/junxingao888/ancestral_retention_signals_cattle. Genome-wide haplotype-mosaic files for locus-level inspection are available in the same repository under External_Data/mosaic, provided for two African taurine reference configurations (N’Dama + Muturu and Muturu only). Lists of putative ancestry-retention genes with per-breed retention percentages are provided under External_Data/putative_genes.
