# ancestral_retention_signals_cattle

Domestic cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus) are pivotal to global animal-based food products but face intensifying pressures from climate change, infectious disease, and inconsistent resource supplies. Understanding how admixture and selection have shaped resilience in indigenous populations is essential to conserving genetic diversity and guiding sustainable breeding. Here, we present whole-genome sequences from 519 cattle across 24 indigenous African and European populations, complemented with 104 public genomes from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. This diverse dataset reveals complex mosaic ancestry among African taurine, European taurine, and indicine lineages, and identifies 48 candidate genes with adaptive allele retention linked to heat and starvation resistance, immune function, radiation tolerance, energy metabolism, and productivity. This study provides new insights into how ecological variability has shaped the selective retention of advantageous ancestral variants in cattle, thereby informing future breeding strategies to address emerging challenges.
